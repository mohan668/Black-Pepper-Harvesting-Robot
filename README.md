## Phase 1 â€“ Robotic Arm Development âœ…

### Completed Tasks:
- Designed and developed a 5-DOF robotic arm using PVC pipes.
- Controlled the arm using NEMA 17 stepper motors and TB6600 motor drivers.
- Implemented motor control logic on Arduino.
- Connected Arduino to Raspberry Pi for serial communication.
- Developed a Flutter mobile application to control the robotic arm.
- Set up a FastAPI backend on Raspberry Pi to receive commands from the Flutter app via Wi-Fi and forward them to the Arduino.

## Phase 2 â€“ Upcoming Objectives ðŸš§

- Design and fabricate a scissor lift mechanism to elevate the robotic arm.
- Integrate a depth sensor and camera for object distance estimation and detection.
- Develop and attach a functional end effector for the robotic arm.
