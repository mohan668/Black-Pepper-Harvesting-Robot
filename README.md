# Black Pepper Harvesting Robot – Phase 1 🌿🤖

This repository documents **Phase 1** of our black pepper harvesting robot project. The goal of this phase was to design and build a functional robotic arm capable of receiving commands over Wi-Fi and executing them precisely using stepper motors and a control circuit.

---

## ✅ Phase 1 – Overview

- ✅ Designed and fabricated a **5-DOF robotic arm** using PVC pipes and custom joints.
- ✅ Interfaced the arm with **NEMA 17 stepper motors** connected via **TB6600 motor drivers**.
- ✅ Controlled the motors using an **Arduino** running step control logic.
- ✅ Integrated the setup with a **Raspberry Pi**, enabling communication between the Arduino and external devices.
- ✅ Developed a **Flutter-based mobile application** to wirelessly control the robotic arm.
- ✅ Built a lightweight **FastAPI backend** running on the Raspberry Pi to receive movement commands from the Flutter app and forward them to the Arduino over serial.

## 📐 Hardware Components

- **Robotic Arm** – 5 Degrees of Freedom (PVC-based)
- **Motors** – NEMA 17 Stepper Motors (with 19:1 gearboxes)
- **Motor Drivers** – TB6600 (1/8 microstepping)
- **Microcontroller** – Arduino Uno
- **Main Controller** – Raspberry Pi 4
- **Power Supply** – 12V DC
- **Miscellaneous** – Limit switches, jumper wires, protoboard, etc.

## 📲 Software Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Mobile App | Flutter |
| Backend API | FastAPI (Python) |
| Serial Communication | Python `pyserial` |
| Motor Control | Arduino Sketch (C++) |

---

## 🔄 System Workflow

1. The **Flutter mobile app** sends commands (e.g., joint angles or directions) over Wi-Fi.
2. The **FastAPI server** hosted on Raspberry Pi receives the command.
3. The Pi translates the command and sends appropriate serial data to the **Arduino**.
4. The **Arduino** drives the **TB6600 motor drivers**, controlling the robotic arm’s joints.
